Hello, my dear reader!

This is a runner in the world of rectangular shapes!
Long ago, when our world was not so detailed, there lived a curious block who always wanted to know if there were other shapes besides rectangles?
He trained a lot and is now ready! He is ready to run through the rectangular world in order to escape beyond its limits. Can you help him? Will there be enough dexterity and skill to discover the riddle of the universe together with him!
Go ahead, run along with Greycube and find out what's beyond the rectangular boundaries!


The main pattern is ecs. Why?! Because!
The project is divided and structured into folders, so there should be no problems with navigation.
The map can be changed by editing the map.bmp file.
Starter.cs - the script from which it all begins.
By selecting the starter object in the inspector, you can see everything you need to create and add new map elements.
